Mini File Host is a free file hosting service script. It is modeled
after the many popular free file hosts like rapidshare
and megaupload. It is easy to set up and use and it
doesn't even require a MySQL database!

Notice: Before you create your own file hosting site,
make sure that you have the resources to do so! If you don't
have a lot of space and bandwidth, you shouldn't run
a file hosting service. If people upload files to your site and
your site is taken down, they won't be very happy.
Also make sure that it isn't against your host's
terms of service to run a file host.

How to install:

 - upload all files and folders from the mfh-1.5-galaxyscripts.zip file to your current MFH Directory
 - Login Into Admin Panel . Default Password Is "password" without the quotes
 - CHMOD all of the .mfh files in secure folder to 777
 - CHMOD the 'storage' folder to 777
 - CHMOD the 'downloader' folder to 777
 - CHMOD the 'uploader' folder to 777
 - CHMOD the 'files' folder to 777
 - CHMOD the 'dl' folder to 777
 - Edit ads.php , bottomads.php and squareads.php according to your needs
 - You're done! Enjoy your new file host!
